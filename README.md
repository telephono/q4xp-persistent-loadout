## Persistent Loadout Plugin for the FlyJSim Q4XP
This plugin saves and restores the fuel tank levels on leaving the aircraft and entering the aircraft in cold and dark.

The fuel tank levels are saved on a per livery basis in a JSON file in the following X-Plane 12 location: `Output/Q4XP/persistent-loadout.json`

To install, download the latest [release](https://github.com/telephono/q4xp-persistent-loadout/releases), extract and copy the `persistent-loadout` folder to the Q4XP's `plugins` directory.
